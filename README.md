# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

**Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!** 🚀
This project showcases an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution, designed to demonstrate real-world data engineering, data modeling, and analytics best practices.

It is built as a portfolio project to highlight skills in designing scalable **data architectures, developing ETL pipelines**, and enabling business-ready analytics.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

**🔹 Bronze Layer – Raw Data**

Ingests raw data from source systems (CSV files)

Data is loaded as-is into a SQL Server database

Serves as a historical record of source data

**🔹 Silver Layer – Cleansed & Conformed Data**

Handles data cleansing, standardization, and normalization

Applies business rules and data quality checks

Prepares data for analytical modeling

**🔹 Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data**

Data is modeled using a star schema

Contains fact and dimension tables

Optimized for reporting, dashboards, and analytical queries
