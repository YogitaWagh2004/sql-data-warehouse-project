# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

**Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!** 🚀

This project showcases an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution, designed to demonstrate real-world data engineering, data modeling, and analytics best practices.

It is built as a portfolio project to highlight skills in designing scalable **data architectures, developing ETL pipelines**, and enabling business-ready analytics.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

**🔹 Bronze Layer – Raw Data** : Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into Mysql Database.

**🔹 Silver Layer – Cleansed & Conformed Data** : This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare     
      data for analysis.

**🔹 Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data** : Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

  1. Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
  2. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
  3. Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
  4. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

**Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)**
Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using Mysql to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications
- Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## 📌 Use Case

This project is ideal for:

Demonstrating real-world data warehouse design

Showcasing analytics engineering skills

Serving as a portfolio project for Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer roles
